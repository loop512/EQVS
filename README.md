The `/Code/BayesianNetworks` directory contains code for building Bayesian networks:
- `Read_data.py`: Reads data from speech samples and saves the extracted codewords into CSV files.  
- `main.py`: Loads codewords from the CSV files, constructs the Bayesian networks, and saves the resulting network structures as images.

The `/Code/EQVS` directory contains code for the EQVS steganalysis model:
- `main.py`: Entry point for training and testing the model.  
- `model/model.py`: PyTorch implementation of the EQVS model.
